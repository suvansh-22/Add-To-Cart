# Add-To-Cart

This Add to Cart function was one of the more fun projects I did while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to create a simple e-commerce-like experience and push myself to make something a bit more dynamic and user-driven. The objective was to make it possible for users to place items in a shopping cart, view the cart in real-time, and have the cart contents remain despite page refreshesâ€”all on the frontend technologies alone and utilizing the browser's local storage.

I began by building a basic product layout with HTML and then styled it with CSS so that it was clean and responsive. I then turned my attention to writing JavaScript code that would manage all the interactive elements: adding items to the cart, updating quantities of individual items, showing the total price, and clearing items from the cart.

Another great learning experience was handling local storage. It taught me how to persist cart information locally so that if a user reloads or comes back to the page, their cart is still there. It made the feature feel more like the world and instructed me on how much of a blessing local storage can be in terms of keeping data in client-side web applications.

I also practised DOM manipulation to dynamically update the cart display whenever the user interacts with it. It was my first time handling slightly more complex logic like checking if a product is already in the cart before adding it again and updating quantities instead of duplicating entries.

This project not only solidified my knowledge of web development fundamentals but also gave me insight into how little things like this go a long way in building a wonderful user experience. It made me eager to continue learning and eventually deploy full e-commerce applications.
